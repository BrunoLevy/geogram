     * \brief Implementation of Delaunay in 2d.
     * \details This package uses concepts inspired by 
     *  two triangulation softwares, CGAL and tetgen,
     *  described in the following references. This package follows the
     *  idea used in CGAL of traversing the cavity from inside, since
     *  it traverses less triangles than when traversing from outside.
     *  - Jean-Daniel Boissonnat, Olivier Devillers, Monique Teillaud, 
     *   and Mariette Yvinec. Triangulations in CGAL. 
     *   In Proc. 16th Annu. ACM Sympos. Comput. Geom., pages 11-18, 2000.
     *  - Hang Si, Constrained Delaunay trianglesl mesh generation and 
     *   refinement. Finite elements in Analysis and Design, 
     *   46 (1-2):33--46, 2010.
     *
     *  Note that the algorithm here does not support vertex deletion nor
     *  degenerate input with all coplanar or all colinear points (use CGAL
     *  instead if you have these requirements).
     *
     *  The core algorithm used in this code, CGAL and tetgen was
     *  independently and simultaneously discovered by Bowyer and Watson:
     *  - Adrian Bowyer, "Computing Dirichlet tessellations", 
     *   Comput. J., vol. 24, no 2, 1981, p. 162-166 
     *  - David F. Watson, "Computing the n-dimensional Delaunay tessellation 
     *   with application to Voronoi polytopes", Comput. J., vol. 24, 
     *   no 2, 1981, p. 167-172
     *
     *  The spatial reordering method, that dramatically increases the 
     *  performances, also used in this code, CGAL and tetgen was introduced
     *  in the following references. The second one is a smart implementation
     *  based on the std::nth_element() function of the STL, that inspired
     *  the compute_BRIO_ordering() function of this package.
     *  - Nina Amenta, Sunghee Choi and Gunter Rote, "Incremental constructions
     *   con brio", ACM Symposium on Computational Geometry 2003.
     *  - Christophe Delage and Olivier Devillers. Spatial Sorting. 
     *   In CGAL User and Reference Manual. CGAL Editorial Board, 
     *   3.9 edition, 2011
     *
     *  The locate() function is based on the following two references. 
     *  The first one randomizes the choice of the next triangle.
     *  The second one uses an inexact locate() function to initialize 
     *  the exact one (it is called "structural filtering"). The first
     *  idea is used in both CGAL and tetgen, and the second one is used
     *  in CGAL.
