 *
 * \param[in] blas opaque handle to BLAS library, can be either host blas or
 *  CUDA blas. If it is CUDA blas, then matrices should be CUDA matrices.
 * \param[in] M the matrix of the system
 * \param[in] P a preconditionner or NULL if not using a preconditioner
 * \param[in] b the right-hand side of the system
 * \param[out] x the solution of the system
 * \param[in] solver one of NL_CG, NL_BICGSTAB, NL_GMRES
 * \param[in] eps convergence bound, iterations are stopped as soon as
 *   \f$ \| Mx - b \| / \| b \| <  \mbox{eps}\f$
 * \param[in] max_iter maximum number of iterations
 * \param[in] inner_iter number of inner iterations, used by GMRES only
